# Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository contains a portfolio of machine learning projects I have worked on. The projects demonstrate my skills in various machine learning techniques and problem domains.

## Projects

### Bike-rentals with AutoML

- Built a regression model to predict a bike rental inspired in the **Explore Automated Machine Learning in Azure ML** exercise - https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AI-900-AIFundamentals/instructions/02-module-02.html
- Optimize EDA with Pandas Profiling 
- Used Pycaret to compare different models metrics and build the best model 
- Achieved 85% R^2 and on test set
